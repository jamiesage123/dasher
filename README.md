# Dasher - Configurable Dashboard
Dasher is a configurable dashboard built in CSS, HTML &amp; Javascript to display appropriate information as required, it is fully customisable with different modules that can be selected as you wish to use them. It is self contained and is shipped with an HTTP server to ensure that you simply run a few commands for it to function.


## Requirements
A nodeJS server (npm installed) - Version 6.7.0

## Installation Guide
To install the node-js modules simply run;

```
npm install
```

Then once all the required packages are installed simply run:

```
npm run dashboard
```

This will kickstart the server and dashboard itself. Once the server has started running simply visit the URL that is given and you will be able to begin using the dashboard (See example of console below)

```
[SERVER] Welcome to Dasher.. We're just loading the server now!
[SERVER] Web Server Started on {YOUR IP}:8080
[SERVER] Socket Server Started {YOUR IP}:8081
[SERVER] Dasher has loaded, visit {YOUR IP}:8080 to view!
```
